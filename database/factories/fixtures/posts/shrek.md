The film's message of acceptance and love, regardless of outward appearances, is powerfully conveyed through its characters and their interactions. [Princess Fiona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Fiona), voiced by [Cameron Diaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Diaz), adds depth to the story with her own secret and transformation, challenging the typical damsel-in-distress trope.
